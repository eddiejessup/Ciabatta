TescoAdd

Input entries in pence. Fractional values are allowed if you must.

Things will go wrong if you have more than %i entries, so don't.

Special input:
    u - Undo last entry, can be done repeatedly if you make multiple mistakes.
    r - Reset sum and start from beginning. Note this cannot be undone.
    x - Exit.
    h - Show this introduction if you weren't paying attention the first time.
    e - Enter expression. Don't get clever though, with great power etc.
        Note expressions are evaluated using 2.x-style division.
